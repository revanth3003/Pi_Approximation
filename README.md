# Pi_Approximation

The file Error.cpp takes the number of intervals (N), as an input into the function and returns both the computed value of Ï€ as well as the corresponding error.
Example : Input : Enter the number of intervals (N) : 55 
         Output : Approximated Pi: 3.13181
                  Error: 0.00978416
                  
The file Interval.cpp takes maximum acceptable error as an input and returns the error and the necessary number of intervals such that the error tolerance is respected.
Example : Input : Enter your maximum acceptable error: 1e-8 
          Output : Error: 9.99998e-09
                    Number of interval: 543283
